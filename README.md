# 3D-mation Android Application

3D-mation android app was developed as a part of Teaching Assistant course curriculum.

It allows you to create and view 360 animation of any product, person, place exactly the way you or your object is to be seen in the real world. The 3D views are created from still photos and turned into an exciting form of video.

It is the best way to showcase the product especially for online selling apps like Amazon, Flipkart etc. because customers can see it from all angles and get an idea of what it really looks like. Also, it will help them to increase their sales too.

No more flipping through dozens of photos.
